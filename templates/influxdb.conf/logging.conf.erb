  # Determines which log encoder to use for logs. Available options
  # are auto, logfmt, and json. auto will use a more a more user-friendly
  # output format if the output terminal is a TTY, but the format is not as
  # easily machine-readable. When the output is a non-TTY, auto will use
  # logfmt.

  # Determines which level of logs will be emitted. The available levels
  # are error, warn, info, and debug. Logs that are equal to or above the
  # specified level will be emitted.

  # The logo is always suppressed if STDOUT is not a TTY.
