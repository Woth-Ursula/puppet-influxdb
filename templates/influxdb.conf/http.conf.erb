[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.

  # Determines whether the HTTP write request logs should be suppressed when the log is enabled.
  # suppress-write-log = <%= @suppress_write_log %>

  # When HTTP request logging is enabled, this option specifies the path where
  # log entries should be written. If unspecified, the default is to write to stderr, which
  # intermingles HTTP logs with internal InfluxDB logging.
  #
  # If influxd is unable to access the specified path, it will log an error and fall back to writing
  # the request log to stderr.
  # access-log-path = "<%= @access_log_path %>"

  # Filters which requests should be logged. Each filter is of the pattern NNN, NNX, or NXX where N is
  # a number and X is a wildcard for any number. To filter all 5xx responses, use the string 5xx.
  # If multiple filters are used, then only one has to match. The default is to have no filters which
  # will cause every request to be printed.

  # Determines whether the pprof endpoint is enabled.  This endpoint is used for
  # troubleshooting and monitoring.
  # pprof-enabled = <%= @pprof_enabled %>

  # Enables authentication on pprof endpoints. Users will need admin permissions
  # to access the pprof endpoints when this setting is enabled. This setting has
  # no effect if either auth-enabled or pprof-enabled are set to false.

  # Enables a pprof endpoint that binds to localhost:6060 immediately on startup.
  # This is only needed to debug startup issues.

  # Enables authentication on the /ping, /metrics, and deprecated /status
  # endpoints. This setting has no effect if auth-enabled is set to false.

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.

  # The default chunk size for result sets that should be chunked.
  # max-row-limit = <%= @max_row_limit%>

  # The maximum number of HTTP connections that may be open at once.  New connections that
  # would exceed this limit are dropped.  Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.

  # Enable http service over unix domain socket

  # The maximum size of a client request body, in bytes. Setting this value to 0 disables the limit.

  # The maximum duration for a write to wait in the queue to be processed.
  # Setting this to 0 or setting max-concurrent-write-limit to 0 disables the limit.
